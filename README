What is this?
=============

This is a shell script to calculate coordinates
of an X11 window and then call ffmpeg to record
screencast with those coordinates.

Press q or Ctrl-C to stop recording.

The resulting mkv file kan be converted to some other
format afterwards by using ffmpeg. For instance:

 ffmpeg -i output.mkv -sameq -an output.avi


Requirements
============

1. xwininfo

The script uses the program xwininfo to get the window coordinates.
In Ubuntu and Debian xwininfo can be found in the x11-utils package.

 # apt-get install x11-utils

In gentoo xwininfo is a separate package, install it with:

 # emerge xwininfo

While some other GNU/Linux distributions (like fedora) place xwininfo
in the package xorg-x11-utils. Install it with your usual package manager.


2. ffmpeg

The program ffmpeg is usually in a package of its own. Just install
it with your package manager.

If the script complains about missing features in ffmpeg
you can try to grab the ffmpeg sources and compile them yourself
with at least the flags:

 ./configure --enable-x11grab --enable-libx264

The configure might also want the flag --enable-gpl in order to enable x11grab.

Get the ffmpeg sources from: http://ffmpeg.org/download.html


OS X
====

Despite its name, most programs in Mac OS X actually does not use X (it
uses something called Core Graphics or Quartz instead). Even if you
compile ffmpeg with x11grab you will only be able to record
applications that runs X, like gimp and wireshark. To record "native"
applications you can try the QuickTime Player, which is included with
Snow Leopard and newer (like Lion). There are also commersial alternatives
(for instance Snapz Pro X) which can be used even if you run an earlier
version of OS X, like Tiger or Leopard. Another option is to actually ask
the kind ffmpeg developers if they might implement a "quartzgrab" format
option sometime in the future.
